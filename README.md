# Responsive-Grid-Structure-Tutorial
Make responsive webpages with simple grid classes.


***  What is meant by responsive website?  ***
Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!

A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.

"In short, responsive website design means that the elements on your website (i.e., texts, images, videos) automatically adjust according to what device it is being visited from."


***  Bootstrap Grid System ***
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page. Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.

***  Grid Classes  ***
The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)

sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)

md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)

lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
